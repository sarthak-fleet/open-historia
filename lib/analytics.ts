/**
 * Owner-facing analytics — the fixed 4-event taxonomy.
 *
 * EVERY fleet project emits exactly these four events — `signup`, `activated`,
 * `core_action`, `returned` — so a single PostHog project can build one
 * cross-fleet funnel (signup -> activated -> core_action) and a D1/D7
 * retention insight, with no custom dashboard.
 *
 * Every event carries a `project_id` property. This is what makes per-app and
 * cross-fleet views possible from one PostHog login.
 *
 * Open Historia's primary flow runs entirely in the browser, so this wrapper
 * is browser-first — it routes through `posthog-js` (`track`)
 * and no-ops on the server.
