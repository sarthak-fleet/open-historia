# agents.md — open-historia

## Shared Fleet Standard

Also read and follow the shared fleet-level agent standard at `../AGENTS.md`. Treat this repository as owned product code: protect production stability, keep changes scoped, verify work, and record durable follow-up tasks when something remains incomplete or blocked.

## Purpose
AI grand-strategy history game — players issue natural language commands to control civilizations; LLM acts as game master returning strict JSON state updates.

## Stack
- Frontend: Vite 8 + React 19 SPA (`src/main.tsx` → `src/router.tsx`, react-router-dom). React Compiler ON via `babel-plugin-react-compiler`.
- Worker/API: Hono on Cloudflare Workers — `src/worker.ts` mounts route modules under `src/worker/routes/*.ts`. Serves the SPA + Astro landing from the `ASSETS` binding.
- Language: TypeScript (strict)
- Styling: Tailwind CSS v4 (`@tailwindcss/vite`; dark/monospace; amber = actions, emerald = success, rose = war)
- Map: MapLibre GL JS (WebGL) via `react-map-gl/maplibre` — 3-tier hierarchical LOD
- DB: Cloudflare D1 + Drizzle ORM
- Auth: better-auth (Google OAuth, optional + Drizzle adapter)
- AI: multi-provider, called server-side in `src/worker/routes/llm.ts` — Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, DeepSeek, free-ai-gateway, local dev bridge
- Testing: Vitest unit (`lib/__tests__/`) + Playwright e2e (`e2e/`, desktop + mobile)
- Deploy: Cloudflare Workers (`open-historia`) via `wrangler deploy` (NOT OpenNext — Next.js was removed in the Vite + Hono migration)
- Package manager: pnpm

## Architecture notes
- **Vite SPA + Hono worker**: the browser loads a React SPA (`app.html`); `/api/*` requests hit the Hono worker (`src/worker.ts`). All AI calls and DB access happen server-side in the worker — provider API keys never run in the browser. SPA routes (`/play`, `/about`, `/privacy`, `/story-room`) fall back to `app.html`; `/` serves the Astro landing.
- **React Compiler ON** — do NOT add manual `useMemo`/`useCallback`.
- **AI as game engine**: AI returns strict JSON — `{ message, updates[], newEvents[], relationChanges[], updatedStorySoFar }`. Always validate AI JSON before applying (`lib/turn-parser.ts`). Contract defined in `lib/ai-prompts.ts`.
- **`storySoFar` pattern**: each turn, AI compresses full history into a running summary to keep token count constant. Only last 8 logs + last 5 events sent as detailed context.
- **Difficulty as AI personality**: `DIFFICULTY_PROFILES` change AI behavior instructions (not numeric stats).
- **Map 3-tier LOD**: Countries (zoom 0–3.5) → Regions/provinces (2.5–6.5) → States/admin1 (5.5+). Admin1 lazy-loaded at zoom 5. Use `queryRenderedFeatures` for hit-testing. Import `MapGL` (not `Map`) from `react-map-gl/maplibre` — avoids shadowing `globalThis.Map`.
- **Auth**: better-auth (not NextAuth). Client: `lib/auth-client.ts`. Server: `lib/auth.ts`. Google OAuth only.
- **Save format**: only `provinceOwners` (id + ownerId) serialized — survives TopoJSON ID changes.
- **Province name matching**: AI may return fuzzy names — `findProvince()` tries exact → suffix-stripped → parent country name.
- **`MapView.tsx` and `GameClient.tsx`** are the largest files — be careful with edits.
- Worker bindings and secrets (`lib/worker-env.ts`, `wrangler.toml`): D1 binding `DB`, plus `BETTER_AUTH_SECRET`, `BETTER_AUTH_URL`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID`, `GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET`, `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` (legacy alias `FREE_AI_API_KEY`), `FREE_AI_GATEWAY_URL`, and `LOCAL_AI_URL`. Vite-baked client vars use the `VITE_` prefix.

## Fleet Guidance

### Adding Tasks
- Add durable work items in SaaS Maker Cockpit Tasks when the task affects product behavior, deployment, user feedback, or fleet maintenance.
- Include the project slug, a concise title, acceptance criteria, priority/status, and links to relevant code, issues, traces, or dashboards.
- If task discovery starts locally in an editor or agent session, mirror the durable next step back into SaaS Maker before handoff.

### Using SaaS Maker
- Treat SaaS Maker as the system of record for project metadata, feedback, tasks, analytics, testimonials, changelog, and fleet visibility.
- Prefer API-first workflows through `fnd api`, the SDK, or widgets instead of one-off scripts when interacting with SaaS Maker features.
- Keep this agent file aligned with the project record when operating rules, integrations, or deployment conventions change.

### Free AI First
- Prefer free/local AI paths for routine development and analysis: the `free-ai` gateway, local models, provider free tiers, and cached context.
- Escalate to paid models only when complexity, correctness risk, or missing capability justifies the cost.
- Note any paid-AI use in the task or handoff when it materially affects cost, reproducibility, or future maintenance.
