// prototype split polish from the primary grand-strategy experience and had no
// path to the core loop. The route was removed from navigation; the code
// (StoryRoomPage, StoryRoomPrototype, story-room-fixtures) is retained in-repo
// as an archived experiment. See PROJECT_STATUS.md for the decision rationale.
